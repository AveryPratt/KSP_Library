# KSP_Library
Framework that provides planetary and rocketry data for KSP-related applications

KSP Library provides many of the building blocks necessary to develop a space/astronomy-related application. The Rocketry namespace contains classes that are relevant to designing rockets and calculating their Î”v, Isp, thrust, and/or thrust to weight ratio for each of their stages. The Systems namespace contains classes to construct various types of celestial bodies (stars, planets, and moons), and also holds information on each celestial body in both the real-life and KSP solar systems. Furthermore, KSP Library can be used to construct other solar systems with different planets and moons should one chose to do so.
